# Lite Cable

Lightweight ActionCable implementation.

Contains application logic (channels, streams, broadcasting) and also (optional) Rack hijack based server (suitable only for development and test due to its simplicity).

Compatible with [AnyCable](http://anycable.io) (for production usage).

## Examples

- [Sinatra LiteCable Chat](https://github.com/palkan/litecable/tree/master/examples/sinatra)

- [Connecting LiteCable to Hanami](http://gabrielmalakias.com.br/ruby/hanami/iot/2017/05/26/websockets-connecting-litecable-to-hanami.html) by [@GabrielMalakias](https://github.com/GabrielMalakias)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'litecable'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install litecable

## Usage

Please, checkout [Action Cable guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_cable_overview.html) for general information. Lite Cable aims to be compatible with Action Cable as much as possible without the loss of simplicity and _ligthness_.

You can use Action Cable javascript client without any change (precompiled version can be found [here](https://github.com/palkan/litecable/tree/master/examples/sinatra/assets/cable.js)).

Here are the differences:

- Use `LiteCable::Connection::Base` as a base class for your connection (instead of `ActionCable::Connection::Base`)

- Use `LiteCable::Channel::Base` as a base class for your channels (instead of `ActionCable::Channel::Base`)

- Use `LiteCable.broadcast` to broadcast messages (instead of `ActionCable.server.broadcast`)

- Explicitly specify channels names:

```ruby
class MyChannel < LiteCable::Channel::Base
  # Use this id in your client to create subscriptions
  identifier :chat
end
```

```js
App.cable.subscriptions.create('chat', ...)
```

### Using built-in server (middleware)

Lite Cable comes with a simple Rack middleware for development/testing usage.
To use Lite Cable server:

- Add `gem "websocket"` to your Gemfile

- Add `require "lite_cable/server"`

- Add `LiteCable::Server::Middleware` to your Rack stack, for example:

```ruby
Rack::Builder.new do
  map '/cable' do
    # You have to specify your app's connection class
    use LiteCable::Server::Middleware, connection_class: App::Connection
    run proc { |_| [200, { 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain' }, ['OK']] }
  end
end
```

### Using with AnyCable

Lite Cable is AnyCable-compatible out-of-the-box. You should write a simple server script:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require "my_app"
require "rack"
require "anycable"

# Turn AnyCable compatibility mode
LiteCable.anycable!

Anycable.connection_factory = MyApp::Connection

Anycable::Server.start
```

And then run this script along with your application. See [Sinatra example](https://github.com/palkan/litecable/tree/master/examples/sinatra) for more.

### Using with Iodine

Lite Cable is also compatible with [Iodine](https://github.com/boazsegev/iodine) out-of-the-box.
It is middleware like built-in server, so you can just add iodine gem and run it like this:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require "my_app"
require "rack"
require "iodine"

# initialize the Redis engine if needed
if ENV["REDIS_URL"]
  uri = URI(ENV["REDIS_URL"])
  Iodine.default_pubsub = Iodine::PubSub::RedisEngine.new(uri.host, uri.port, 0, uri.password)
else
  puts "* No Redis, it's okay, pub/sub will still works inside Iodine connections"
end

LiteCable.iodine!

app = Rack::Builder.new do
  map '/cable' do
    # You have to specify your app's connection class
    use LiteCable::Iodine::RackApp, connection_class: App::Connection
    run proc { |_| [200, { 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain' }, ['OK']] }
  end
end

run app

```

### Configuration

Lite Cable uses [anyway_config](https://github.com/palkan/anyway_config) for configuration.

See [config](https://github.com/palkan/litecable/blob/master/lib/lite_cable/config.rb) for available options.

### Unsupported features

- Channel callbacks (`after_subscribe`, etc)

- Stream callbacks (`stream_from "xyz" { |msg| ... }`)

- Periodical timers

- Remote connections.
